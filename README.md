# Activity 11
## Due: 9am on February 12, 2025

## Objectives
- Understand how convolutional filters work in image processing
- Experiment with different filters to observe their effects
- Modify filter values and sizes to create custom effects

## Tasks
1. Apply Standard Filters
   - These are given in the code as `filter_a`, `filter_b`, and `filter_c`
   - Identify what each one is (e.g., blurr, edge detection, sharpen)
2. Modify Filter Values
   - Change values in the edge detection filters and observe the effects
   - Conduct three experiments with modified value(s). For example, what effect does increasing the middle value in `filter_a` or `filter_b` have?
3. Change Filter Size
   - Modify at least one of the 3×3 filters to a larger size (e.g., 5×5)
   - How does increasing the filter size affect the image?

## Observations

1. Compare the output images for different filters and determine the function of each filter

- `filter_a`: TODO
- `filter_b`: TODO
- `filter_c`: TODO

2. Explain what values you modified and how modifying the filter value changed the image

- Experiment 1: TODO
- Experiment 2: TODO
- Experiment 3: TODO

3. Discuss how changing the filter size affected the output

    TODO

## Assessment

To receive a point for this activity, submit a modified README with your answers under "Observations" and modified `filters.py` with your larger filter example.
